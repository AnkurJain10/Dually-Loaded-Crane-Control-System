# Dually Loaded Crane's Control System

This project was made for the University of Maryland's Graduate degree course:
Control of Robotic Systems

The problem statement is in two parts.
1) The basic construction of the Dually loaded crane and its basic control system.
2) The complex control of the crane using a Luenberger observer and also an output feedback controller.

The second part was the main Final project and it is that which has been uploaded here.

Thank You!
